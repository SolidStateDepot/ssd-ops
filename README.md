# SSD Operations

This is a place for organizing tasks and issues related to operations at SSD.

As you can see, there's no content here other than this README file. The action is all in the "issues" tab. We may add code and documents here in the future, though.


For the unfamiliar, [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is fully supported here. Here are a few examples relevant for generic task-tracking:

 - Reference issues using `#` (e.g. `#23`)
 - Ping GitHub users using `@`
 - Generate nifty checkable bullet lists using ` - [ ]` or `* [ ]`.
 - Refer to peoples' comments using `>`
